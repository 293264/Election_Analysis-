## Overview of Election Audit ##

   * In this analysis, we examined voter registration data to assist in completing an election audit for the US Congressional Precinct in Colorado. Additional information has been requested so that the audit can be completed.

     * The voter turnout for each county
     * The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
     * The county with the highest turnout.

     In this report, the election commission will receive a written analysis of the election audit, including the new results, as well as a clearly written description of the methods used during the audit.

## Election Audit Summary ##

  * If two-thirds of the votes were required for the election, this script could be easily modified to check for a majority winner. Using the county data, weights could be assigned to the counties to represent the weight of the electoral college votes. If these two changes were added to the script, the election commission might consider a business proposal to make these adjustments, and the script could calculate nearly any election.
