     * The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count

## Election Audit Summary ##

  * If two-thirds of the votes were required for the election, this script could be easily modified to check for a majority winner. Using the county data, weights could be assigned to the counties to represent the weight of the electoral college votes. If these two changes were added to the script, the election commission might consider a business proposal to make these adjustments, and the script could calculate nearly any election.
